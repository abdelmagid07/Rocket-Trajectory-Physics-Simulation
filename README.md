# Rocket-Trajectory-Physics-Simulation

Simulates a rocket launch in MATLAB by modeling real-world physics such as thrust, fuel burn, gravity variation with altitude, and changing mass. The simulation calculates the rocket's vertical and horizontal motion over time and visualizes key data through plots.

## Description and Tracked Data

- Vertical velocity
- Altitude
- Horizontal velocity
- Downrange distance
- Acceleration and total velocity
- Fuel Burnout point
- Maximum altitude

Using physics equations and time-stepping, the rocket is launched at an 80° angle with thrust applied until the fuel runs out. After fuel burnout, gravity alone affects the rocket’s motion until it begins descending.

## Features
- Realistic gravity that decreases with altitude
- Thrust-based acceleration and fuel consumption
- Mass reduction over time as fuel burns
- Calculates time, altitude, velocity, and distance
- Multiple MATLAB plots for data visualization
- Unit conversion to display mph, miles, and seconds
